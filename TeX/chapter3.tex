\chapter{Mobile development approaches}

The definition of mobile development can be interpreted in a variety of ways. It can be seen as a broad process of implementing a mobile application, starting with planning and designing and finishing with testing, releasing and maintaining. A more software-oriented definition is that mobile development simply refers to implementing an application for mobile devices by coding it using a selected technology stack \cite{microsoft_mobile_development}. In this thesis, the latter definition is assumed.

Mobile development can become a complex task considering the variety of devices and platforms existing in the market. There are many different approaches available and in order to choose one over another the mobile application requirements should be taken into account as well as target platforms and devices, development and time costs \cite{velvetech_mobile_dev_approaches}.

In this chapter, there are presented selected popular approaches to mobile application development. Each of them is described mainly in the context of architecture, technology stack and tools, platforms supported and possible advantages or disadvantages.
