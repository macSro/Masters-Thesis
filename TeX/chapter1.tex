This template is an adaptation of the template elaborated by Wojciech Myszka (see https://kmim.wm.pwr.edu.pl/myszka/projekty).
The template worked successfully in the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overleaf.com -- an on-line version; no installation required
    \item TeXStudio/TeXLive or TeXStudio/MiKTeX or TeXWorks/MiKTex
\end{itemize}

Usage of the full version may require (e.g. for TeXWorks/MikTeX):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python 2.7+ plus Pygments scripts installed; path to both should be set to the PATH environment variable -- they are used to color source code keywords in programming language
    \item -shell-escape option for Latex compiblation enabled -- required by the minted Latex package
\end{itemize}
