\chapter{Discussion}

In multiple literature positions, statements can be found about mobile app performance being significantly higher when developing using native approach compared to cross-platform approach. However, even in many rather recent papers this statement is assumed based on the work of P. Que, X. Guo and M. Zhu (\cite{que_comp_hybrid_native}) which was published in 2016. Across the past 7 years there have been many breaking changes in both native and multi-platform solutions. It is reasonable to assume they may have changed that situation therefore it is worthwhile to review the current state-of-art and draw present-day conclusions.
